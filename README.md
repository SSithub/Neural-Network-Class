# Neural Network Class/Library For Java

An adjustable neural network class or library without dependencies outside of Java's API packages, with an example of solving the XOR problem along with a classification variation.

Thought it would be easier to have the necessities of neural networks in one class, [the NNLib class](https://github.com/SSithub/Neural-Network-Library-Class/blob/Floats/src/neuralnetwork/NNLib.java). I add features when I need to use them in my other projects.

I could not think of another way to display a graph in JavaFX of the progress of the network, so I settled on a outer class that nests the neural network class inside.

See the included [XOR problem](https://github.com/SSithub/Neural-Network-Library-Class/blob/Floats/src/neuralnetwork/XOR.java) for an example on initializing a neural network. There is also a [classification variation of the XOR problem](https://github.com/SSithub/Neural-Network-Library-Class/blob/Floats/src/neuralnetwork/XOR_Classification.java).
